## Virtual Instrument: Arduino & DS18B20 temperature sensor.

###### Created as a university task: NTUU KPI, The Faculty of Electronics, The Department of Design of Electronic Digital Equipment (DEDEC/KEOA).

This is a simple Virtual Instrument, designed for interaction between an Arduino board and a DS18B20 temperature sensor, and for visualization of the received temperature data and saving it to a file.

**You must install a VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) driver to provide the PC-board communication.**
